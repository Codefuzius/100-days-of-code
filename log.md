### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: January 2nd, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I've set up my 100-days-of-code-fork and started with the Javascript-Course at Codecademy.
Did the first part of JS-Introduction.

**Thoughts** At last I'm beginning, it will be slower than the official challenge, but I took the first step!

### Day 2: January 3nd, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Did the next part of JS-Introduction.
Since I'm doing this course the second time, now in the new version, I see the differences between ES6 and before. Nice :)

**Thoughts** Do mistakes! You'll learn from it a lot' And don't think your're too stupid, you're not!
